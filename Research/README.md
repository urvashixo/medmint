reMedi is a beginner-friendly toolkit for drug discovery that uses some of the most advanced AI models for designing new compounds, like TamGen, chemBERTa, and DeepPurpose. It also includes smart tools for searching with graphs to find relations between existing entities (genes, proteins etc), understanding molecule structures, and using Perplexity Sonar API to proovide more context to the generated results making it more human interpretable and accelerating research

reMedi streamlines the most resource-heavy and uncertain stages of early drug discovery — from identifying a viable target to generating and evaluating candidate compounds. This drastically reduces time, cost, and cognitive overhead for researchers, bridging gaps between silos and boosting the chances of clinical success.

Drug discovery takes around 10-15 years [Source: DiMasi, J. A., Grabowski, H. G., & Hansen, R. W. (2016). Innovation in the pharmaceutical industry: New estimates of R&D costs. Journal of Health Economics, 47, 20–33.] reMedi accelerates drug discovery by unifying the entire pipeline — from molecule creation to deep biological insight — into a single, intuitive system. It’s not just faster — it’s smarter, more connected, and built for the urgency of real-world healthcare, saving 3-5 years of development time and plans to save more in future iterations


Use the example of 2qwo (a protein related to DnaK protein, In pancreatic cancer, the protein DNAJA1 (which interacts with DnaK) has been found to be overexpressed, potentially impacting cancer cell survival and migration. The .cif files from the RCSB PDB database have been already added making generation much faster. Other protein’s compound generation may take 15minutes

## Installation On Local Computer

**NOTE:** This project was built and compiled on wsl, please use a linux machine to run this otherwise you may run into os errors (servers use linux anyways :P). Most of the packages are listed in requirements.txt a few packages to be installed from github has been left out.

packages not in requirements (install them inside conda environment after installing everything in requirements.txt):
-git+https://github.com/bp-kelley/descriptastorus@9a190343bcd3cfd35142d378d952613bcac40797
-git+https://github.com/SigmaGenX/TamGen@9459b3f0290ea7b79061d9e81eae284f93891a82#egg=fairseq
    > this is a tricky package to install, your python environment must be 3.11 not higher and your pip must be "pip<24.1"
-pyvis (just pip install this)
-torch-cluster (just pip install this)
-flask (just pip install this)
-flask-cors (just pip install this)

also install these
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install pandas
pip install torch_geometric
pip install pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.3.0+cu121.html
pip install rdkit==2024.03.1

pip install einops
pip install ipykernel
conda install pytorch==2.3.0

If anything still goes wrong, please feel free to message me or drop an issue here and I would guide you through it

### Local Enviroment - Setting up

Requirements:

- Linux or MacOS
- Docker
- Conda

Git clone and navigate to project repo

Setup Docker: Type in terminal - This will install and run an image of ArangoDB with password=perplexity

```
docker compose up -d
```

Create a conda environment

```
conda create --n remedi python=3.11
conda activate remedi
```

Install requirements and the listed above requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

inside main.py (server) on line 295 replace the text with your perplexity api key,
not the best approach but this whole project was made in between my final exams hence tried to save time here and there, you may make your .env file 


running it:

Run the cells in **resourceGather.ipynb**
after that create the database using **databaseCreation.ipynb**

after this your database would be created, but i also hosted the database on gcp, incase you cannot then ask me for the credentials and i would mail you

update the db.py with your database credentials

then run main.py

```
python3 main.py
```
this will start the flask server which has all the endpoints

/generate-compound has the endpoints to generate compound pdb id of protein

it gives 3 results, none if the protein does not have ligands, only a refernce compound to start researching with if it cannot create compounds for the protein and a set of generated compounds when everything is doable

it usually takes 5-10 minutes to generate on my computer due to low memory and not powerful enough cpu. Make sure you have atleast 16-32gb of ram to avoid the server from freezing or crashing altogether. If you use gunicorn and it eats up a lot of memory, shift to running it using python3 main.py


```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate-compounds -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"pdb_id\":\"2qwo\"}"

```

/pdb-sequence for getting the amino acid sequence from pdb id of protein
```
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:5000/pdb-sequence?pdb_id=2qwo"
```
/predict-binding-affinity to predict the binding affinity between a compound (in SMILES representation) and sequence of proteins
```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict-binding-affinity -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"smile\":\"Nc1ncnc2c1ncn2[C@@H]1O[C@H](CO)[C@@H](OP(=O)(O)OP(=O)(O)O)[C@H]1O\", \"target_sequence\":\"MKVLYNLV...\"}"
```

/text-to-aql for converting text to graph queries using perplexity so researchers can easily find relations

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/text-to-aql -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\": \"Which drugs bind to EGFR?\"}"

```
**NOTE**: The backend is already hosted on google cloud platform as a vm, at the external ip- http://35.193.196.5:5000 , you may query from it, if it is not running (may get shutdown as its on free tier) contact me i'll turn it on.

Frontend:

The front end is built on React+Vite, install react-router-dom and everything would be fine, on research.jsx page search for authorization and add your perplexity API key in it, it would appear 3 time, i could had made an env variable or an actual variable but in rush i didnt think much about it. I would refactor the code after hackathon

the endpoints are setup just change the parent url according to your server ip (localhost or my gcp server), 
## Architecture

reMedi is designed as a modular, multi-model system that brings together powerful tools for end-to-end drug discovery. Its flexible setup allows researchers to easily expand or customize the toolkit, as all core components and data connections are built in from the start.

1. **Core Modules**

   - **TamGen:** A transformer-based generative model trained on over 120 million SMILES strings of bioactive compounds. It generates novel molecules, which are automatically validated and docked to target proteins.
   - **DeepPurpose:** A versatile deep learning framework that predicts the binding affinity between drugs and target proteins. It complements TamGen by analyzing and refining already-docked compounds for better accuracy.
   - **chemBERTa:** A transformer model also trained on 120+ million SMILES sequences. It creates rich vector embeddings for molecules, enabling advanced analysis and repurposing of both FDA-approved and newly generated compounds.

2. **Knowledge Graph & Retrieval Modules**

   - **ArangoDB**: A multi-model database that organizes relationships between genes, proteins, diseases, drugs, and molecules in a structured, connected way.
   - **Graph-based querying** Allows smart retrieval of molecular data—linking known drug-target interactions to newly generated compounds for comparison or discovery..


3. **GraphRAG & Biomedical Reasoning**
   - **GraphRAG framework** Augments traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) methods by incorporating graph-based reasoning for biomedical data
   - **Ontological mapping**: Integrates structured biomedical ontologies (e.g., DrugBank, ChEMBL) to enhance retrieval and inference.

4. **Perplexity Natural Language Interface**
    
    - **Perplexity Sonar Integration**
      Allows researchers to ask natural language questions (e.g., “What compounds bind to the EGFR T790M mutation?”), which are translated into structured AQL (ArangoDB Query Language) queries using the Perplexity Sonar API.

      it also provides context and insights to the result that help towards research in front end

    - **LangChain Bridge**
      reMedi connects Perplexity to the rest of the system via LangChain, enabling fluent conversion from plain English to executable queries over molecular, protein, or disease graphs.

      Use Cases

      Aids with deep research with proper citations

      Convert natural language to graph queries

      Provide more insights and context on results from backend to give the researchers some idea about the entity
